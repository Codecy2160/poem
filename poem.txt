Feelin' a sorrowful rage
A poisonous phage
Tryna flip the page
Of something I cant gauge
Trapped in a cage
Talking to the sage
Of the ice age
Asked what I need to change
Led me to a beige
Coloured mage
Gave no wage
But a dog's mange
To engage
And rummage
The aged
The vintage
Talked to the deranged
Gave my soul in exchange
Though I cant range
My thought and words, strange
Looking afar mirror image
deceitful need to reengage 
Emotions out on a scrimmage
Heart was enraged
No time for marriage
Might miscarriage
Might turn savage
Sour beverage
Never got the courage
To go on rampage
On the stage
Never gave my gage
A generic sausage
Made out of swage
Left in bondage
By the drage
Stronghold showing cleavage
Time to gain the leverage
To deal the damage
And leave the message
Payed my homage
To old school cartilage
Gained right of passage
Though could never manage
